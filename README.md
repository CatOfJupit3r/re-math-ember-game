# Re-math-ember me
this is a little training program to help you memorise or/and practice integrals and derivatives

## How to use
1. Download the repository
2. Launch the `game.exe` file
3. Or launch the `game.py` file with python3 via the terminal 
4. Choose the type of game you want to play (integrals or derivatives)
5. Enjoy!

_~~In case you need to refresh your memory on integrals or derivatives, I left a little media sheet in the data folder~~_ 

I strongly recommend using standard or easy modes first, as the hard mode requires you to write formulas as they are written in `data/*.json` files

don't forget to star the repository if you like it!
If you encounter any bugs, please report them in the issues section or fix them yourself and make a pull request!

And yes, I did this program instead of studying for my exams, and yes, I'm proud of it.
